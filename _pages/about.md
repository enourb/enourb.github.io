I am an aspiring economist currently working as a Research Analyst at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in the International Studies department. I work with economists Ozge Akinci, Marco Del Negro, and Gianluca Benigno on topics such as macro-finance modeling, supply chain dynamics, and exchange rates.

I was a Mathematics and Economics double major with a Data Science Minor at Northwestern University. As an undergraduate, I worked with Ameet Morjaria, Vivek Bhattacharya, and Deborah Weiss on development, industrial organization, and labor respectivley.
